# Cigarette Smoking & Negative Emotionality

This was a project I worked on in my undergraduate statistics class. I used the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Refresher dataset to test whether smokers and non-smokers had statistically significant levels of Negative Emotionality/Neuroticism. I calculated descriptive statistics and preformed a two-independent samples t-test with alpha equal to .01.

The results of the test about the mean Neuroticism scores of smokers and nonsmokers were significant, t(210.71) = 3.07, p = .001. Therefore, there is evidence to suggest that the mean Neuroticism scores of smokers (M = 2.22, SD = 0.66) was significantly higher than the mean Neuroticism scores of nonsmokers (M = 2.01, SD = 0.59).

This was my first data analysis project and one of my first research papers involving quantitative methods.
